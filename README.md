# A/B-Testing-and-Blue/Green-Deployments
- Blue/Green deployment (Blue is current running version, Green env running different version of application) is the technique we use for releasing application by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application. Advantage: Avoid downtime (near zero downtime), Convinent in rollback.  
- Once Green environment is tested, we shift our production to green environment. Following Patterns can be used depending on use case: update DNS routing, swaping ASG behind ELB, Docker B/G deployments and updating ASG Launch configuration.
- In A/B Testing, we run two different version of application in two different environments and get it tested by users. User feedback will determine the between them. 

### â†’Updating DNS Routing
- Use this pattern if you have the DNS name or IP of your environment.
- Use Route53 all at once or weighted routing policies.
- Example would be having EC2 instances or having ECS container behind ELB (since ELB provides us DNS name, so we are good).
